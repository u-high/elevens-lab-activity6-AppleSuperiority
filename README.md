1. 5(spade) AND 6 | 5(clove) AND 6 | 

2. They must be K Q and J because you can't play more than 2 cards unless it is that group of three so if it was three other numbers such as 10, 9, and 2 then the 10 would be left on the field and you would lose

3. The game does not involve any strategy, when more than one move is possible just make the match and it's all based on luck from that point on unless say you had a 10, 2 ACES, a 9, and a 2, the most logical play to do would be to take out the 10 and one of the Aces in hopes of getting another 10 on the field but the same result can be acquired from switching 9 and 2 so with that in mind there is no real strategy to this game that I can see because I think its all based on luck
